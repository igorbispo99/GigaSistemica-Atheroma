# GigaSistemica-Atheroma

This study introduced a hybrid deep learning model to detect and segment carotid atheroma calcifications (CACs) in dental panoramic radiographs (PR). The proposed method combines the efficiency of an attention mechanism with the precision of the UNet architecture. It enables the identification and segmentation of CACs by utilizing an automated two-step process, offering a reliable and practical tool for opportunistic screening in dental settings. The model facilitates the detection of potential atherosclerosis-related risks, providing an accessible, non-invasive, and cost-effective diagnostic approach.

Status: Under review at IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (JBHI).
